<p>
    Despite my handle, I know extremely little about gramophones and turtles. 
    They were just a friend I doodled one day and then later I desparately turned them when I needed a "cool username".
</p>
<p>
    Call me Sal, or Gramophone or Turtle, since I've had this handle attached to me. 
    My pronouns are they/them, I'm gendervoid (kinda like agender, which falls under the non-binary umbrella).
</p>
<p>
    I'm also aromantic and asexual, both kinda on the repulsed side. 
    Because of that, for me personnaly, you're not going to see shipping content unless it's of the platonic variety.
    Even then it'll probably have it's own warning cause if my brain is like that even with platonic ships, then I know it'll help someone else too.
