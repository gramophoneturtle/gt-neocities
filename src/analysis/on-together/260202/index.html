<p>Found this game because of Pillowfort so I wanted to share my experiences with it! The three screenshots above show my avatar enjoying an adorable drink at the cafe, crocheting in a comfy pillow swing seat, and how I have the game set up on my stream during my co-working sessions. You can get some fun camera angles as shown in the first and last ones.</p>

<p>In short, it's a productivity game like Spirit City, Ithya, Not Monday Cafe and similar where you have productivity tools like pomodoro timers and lovely background environments, but the basis of this one has you connect to a server to join another person's game or and open up a game for other people to join yours <em>if you wish</em>. You can have the game run full screened, windowed, take up the side or top/bottom of the screen, or use a unique sticker mode where you can have your avatar (and nearby friends) show up over top of your screen, along with the circular pomodoro timer, task list, etc. too if you wish. There's a variety of activities your avatar can do to mirror yours and there's plenty of fun things you can do when need a break or want to mess around with friends.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed using it on stream and on my own so far, even with making private 1 person rooms. This game came out very recently so there's a lot of room for feedback and future changes.</p>

<p>So you might ask, is it really based in co-working with others? Yes, but you can make your own private 1 person room and just use it as a solo productivity tool with little mini-games like fishing or finding new pet companions when you need a break. You're given quite a big island with various locations, but most seating areas are designed with a group of people in mind, so it can feel quite spacious for one person.</p>
<p>When you first start up the game and are ready to play, you're asked to create or join a Game. You can filter existing Games by different Social Tag labels (Focus Together, Playtime, etc.) and join from the list below, or from your friends list or by Server ID. The Server ID lets you join the server with that ID, even private ones. You can toggle on the request to join as the host so you can only let in people you know.</p>

<p><em><sub>Options to either Create a Game or Join a Game. You need to do one or the other before you can start co-working.&nbsp;</sub></em></p>
<p>Like Spirit City and Not Monday Cafe, you can customize your avatar! You can be a human, cat person, dog person, wolf person and a bunny person at the moment. There's three avatar slots and you can name them too. (I made one avatar after my Father OC of course. :]) You can also customize your desk whenever you need it for your desk related activities.</p>

<p>Like Spirit City and Ithya, you can find little companions. In this game, they're pets that so far have been doing one of the different types of activities you can do. For example, the cat in the above screenshot is reading, and this doggo below is exercising. The game gives you hints on how to find each pet when you click on them in the pet grid. You can buy different coloured variations too with the in game currency of tickets! You earn tickets by being productive and by playing mini-games, like fishing. (More on fishing later.)</p>

<p>There's a lot of activities or Focus you can choose from. Some depend on where you focus. For example, focusing by the campfire will give you option to roast a marshmallow. If you're not near a seat or a specific focus area, you can still open your focus menu and get a wide range of options like below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><sub>The broad focus anywhere categories are Art, Connect, Eat, Exercise, Listen, Meditate, Read, Write and Clean. The Exercise focus options are lifting weights, DDR hopping around, jump rope, 3 dancing options, and a running treadmill that will poof into existence wherever you are.</sub></em></p>
<p>So I mentioned the world is big. To help you get around, you use bubblegum to rise up...</p>

<p>And an umbrella to float down! (Yes you can customize your umbrella too!) You can buy a variety of foods that allow you to move faster, jump higher, or create special effects like having a rainbow trail after you. There are also different bubblegum flavours that cause your bubblegum to behave differently. Some make it easier to get around and others are there for chaos!</p>

<p><em><sub>My Father avatar catches a pike from the river while my friend Clancy paints Father fishing from across the river.</sub></em></p>
<p>Fishing! There's 5 rarities of fish and you can upgrade your fishing gear to get rarer fish. There's a fish log book that keeps track of which fish you've caught and what you're missing. It's a good way to get tickets, and you do need tickets to buy different kinds of bait to fish.</p>
<p>So what about friends?</p>
<figure style="max-width: 100%;">

<p><em><sub>My Father avatar paints my friend Clancy eating at the cafe.</sub></em></p>
<p>When people join your server you can choose to display their name, and if they have a pomodoro timer running, you can see their timer, so you can tell when they should be focusing or are on a break session. You can emote to each other and chat by text in game.</p>

<p><em><sub>On-Together is in sticker mode over top of Clip Studio Paint, which has a screenshot of my Father avatar chilling on a small island. The main larger island, is behind him. The sticker mode is the same location as the screenshot, but from a higher angle.</sub></em></p>
<p>So far I've been really enjoying the game. It's cute, there's a fair amount of customization and I appreciate the different focus activities. I like how the pomodoro timer is on the larger and can be moved like Spirit CIty's even if you can't resize it, compared to Ithya's which is smaller and it locked to the top of the screen. The sticker mode makes this stand out a lot. I can have my avatar and the circular pomodoro timer visible and not have the game take up the entire window or a large porion of the screen. Having friends join you is a wonderful option. I know it's been a request feature in Spirit City, so it's a nice option to have this be a selling point from the get go, even if I don't imagine playing this game with friends or strangers too often outside of stream if I feel up for it.</p>
<p>There's a lot of nice to haves that I'd like to see added to this game, such as different times of day, a countdown timer, and a way to start the game without requiring making a server, and other things. Some of these has been requested in their Discord, so I'm curious to see how this game develops. I think this will be my Spirit City replacement for my productivity stream game, but that partially depends on how Spirit City plans to address their recent UI changes which had me quitting the game unfortunately. And if Spirit City does fix their UI then this will be a nice game to swap over to when I want a change of pace.</p>
