    <p>NEO Demo Analysis on Inversion: Artistic piece but also notes things that already have inverted themes. [21-07-19]</p>
     
   <h2>Analysis</h2>

    <p>This is ONLY based on the demo and not anything else. I've not seen anything else about NEO aside from the demo and do not wish to before I play the game. Maybe after playing NEO if this is a actual Thing I'll make a separate post instead of an art post.</p>

    <p>There's a couple instances of inverting things in the demo, starting with the Prologue. The bird(?) shaped thing is also Composer styled and either one can be inverted to kinda match the other.</p>

    <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> The noise symbols in NEO have a red body and a black outline, while in TWEWY they have a black body and red outline.</p>

    <p><strong>Day 2:</strong> Pig Noise. The colour is also swapped. Side note that the scanning colours are inverted to each other - pink sky and green…everything else.</p>

    <p>More can probably be said about the background image inverted in TWEWY for when you fight pig noise and apply it to the regular noise background symbol, but clearly the most important thing is that the pig noise symbol has four holes in it, just like the symbol on the Reaper Pin! Therefore it's super duper important, right?</p>

    <p>Anyways, this could just be stylistic changes or actual hints to an Inversion. Regardless, inverting a Composer is extremely interesting on its own.</p>
