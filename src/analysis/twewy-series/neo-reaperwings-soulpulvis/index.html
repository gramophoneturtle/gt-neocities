            <span>While playing around with ideas for my AU, I came across some interesting similarities between Reaper Wings and
            Soul Pulvis Wings.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>We've seen both in the TWEWY and in the Animation that Minamimoto has had quite interesting wings. He has
            multiple pairs of wings. They can shatter or can gain a purple Taboo haze depending on the media. They're messed up
            in some way.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Even though Minamimoto isn't a Reaper in NEO, could our Chaotic Math Man have 
            <em>a new type of</em> messed up wings as he continues to absorb dangerous birds?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Let's dive into that and see where that leads.</span>

          <p>Since they are similar to bat wings, I'm going to try and use the same terminology where I can.</p>

                An image of Coco's Reaper Wing and then the same image beside it with mark ups explaining the following: The Arm leading up to a central point called the Wrist where the Thumb(s) and Fingers usually extend from.

          <p>Generally speaking, we have the Arm leading up to a central point called the Wrist where the Thumb(s) and Fingers can
          extend from. One outer Finger forms the outside edge of the wing and then multiple inner Fingers extend out from the
          Wrist and along the Arm. The Reaper wings also have a smaller extrusion right by the Thumb too, which can either be a
          second Thumb or another Finger. The Fingers extending downwards are connected by an Arc, which connects back to the
          Arm.</p>

          <p>Coco's wings are smaller and more curvy while Kariya's are larger and sharper. Uzuki's are even larger,
          very rigid, and the inner Fingers don't all extend out from the Wrist, but along the Arm.</p>

          <p>For the extra piece by the big Thumb, I'm leaning towards it being another Thumb, for theory crafting reasons way
          below. But if sticking with bat terminology, it would be another Finger I think.</p>

          <p>We kinda get to see Shinjuku Reaper Wings. I did some Level Correction to see some of their wings better. (Mourn the
          variety. It's hoodies only in Shibuya, if you're not good enough, or something.)</p>
          <p>Anyways, they generally follow Kariya's wing style.</p>

                Three Pig Noise with Reaper Wings from The World Ends With You and NEO: The World Ends With You, in two rows of 3 and 2.

        </div>
          <p>In TWEWY, Pig Butoh (along with Polka and Tango, blue and red colour palette swaps) have Reaper like wings. In NEO, we
          have Pig Mambo (light) and Pig Bolero (dark). It's a little hard to tell but they appear to have the same wing shape
          as they do in TWEWY, just that they curl around in front. The overlap might make it look like it creates a
          "gap" like the wings like for the Pig Mambo (light).</p>
          <p>Both the Reaper and Pig wings have a connecting Arc across the Fingers. However, the Pig Noise has an extra piece
          where the Arm connects to the body, not like the little Thumb or extra Finger by the big Thumb for Reaper Wings, and
          there is a circular cut or hole removed from the Thumb.</p>
          <p>But in general, we can see that Reapers and Pig Noise have a similar structure to their wings.</p>
          <p>Now let's get theory crafting!</p>

          <p>So how are Soul Pulvis wings and Reaper wings related?</p>
          <p>I stumbled on this by trying to make a Reaper Wing look a little more like a Soul Pulvis wing, and then made a Soul
          Pulvis wing look a little like a Reaper Wing. Added an additional step, modified the other stages and I got something
          like this:</p>

          <div>
            <img alt="Showing gradual transformation of the Reaper Wing to the Soul Pulvis Wing with three in between stages. The Reaper Wing breaks the &quot;fingers&quot; and forms into the center star eye for the Soul Pulvis wing."

            </details>
          </div>
        </div>
          <p>With that, we can see that the Soul Pulvis has a similar wing structure to the Reaper Wings:</p>

            <img alt="An image of the Soul Pulvis wings with the right side marked up, explaining the following: The Arm leading up to a central point called the Wrist where the Thumb(s) and Fingers usually extend from. One Finger that forms the outer edge. There is a gap between the Wrist and the Arc where the Fingers extrude from, with e starry eye in the center, coming from the Wrist. There is an extrusion right by the Thumb too, which can either be a second Thumb or another Finger. The Fingers extending downwards are connected by an Arc."

                An image of the Soul Pulvis wings with the right side marked up, explaining the following: The Arm leading up to a central point called the Wrist where the Thumb(s) and Fingers usually extend from.

          </div>
        </div>
          <p>The fully connected inner Fingers in the Reaper Wing gets separated from the Wrist. One Finger moves down to where it
          would connect to the body, kinda like the Pig Noise or maybe like Uzuki's Wings. A star &quot;eye&quot; symbol
          appears in the gap between the Arm, outer Finger and Arc. The Arm and Thumb have shrunk. The second Thumb or other Finger
          by the old big Thumb has grown and now is curving in the opposite direction, away from the Thumb. We could say that the
          central Star Eye is part of the Fingers or is an entirely new thing.</p>
          <p>So what does this mean?</p>
          <p>Well, if we were able to see Minamimoto's Reaper wings during NEO (say if, an Angel could still see them), I think
          they could be at various stages of the above transformation. Maybe they would not reach the same design as the Soul
          Pulvis wings, but I think they would at least have gotten influenced by his bird snacking.</p>
          <p>But that's not all.</p>
          <p>There is something else that is similar to the Soul Pulvis and is linked to 
          <em>some</em> Minamimoto:</p>

          <p>The open floating eyes that Felidae Cantus, Minamimoto from NEO's Another Day's Noise form, has. And it can be
          hard to tell, but there are Soul Pulvis flying circling around the fight, in addition to the mathematical formulas.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Keeping the Soul Pulvis and the open floating eyes that Felidae Cantus has in mind, we can see similarities. Let's
          do another transformation to make it clearer:</p>
        </div>
        <div>

                  <img alt="An image showing the transformation of a Soul Pulvis Wing into one of the floating eyes from the Felidae Cantus fight.

The part between the two thumbs and where the star eye comes out is labelled the wrist."
                  srcset="https://gramophoneturtle.neocities.org/img/refs/twewy/neo/SoulPulvisToEyes.png"/>
                </span>
              </div>
              <div>
                <details>

                    </p>

            </div>
        </div>
          <p>Most of the transformation occurs on the side closest to the body. There is a question of how the body side of the
          wing either grows another Finger or if the innermost Finger strengthens its attachment back to the other inner Fingers.
          But really they're not that different. And there are some similarities to the Reaper wings too. The tips of the
          Fingers are closer to the pointy Reaper wing spikes instead of the Soul Pulvis curves.</p>
          <p>If the floating Eyes are not something separate, they could be Soul Pulvis wings that separated from their body.</p>
          <p>This is why if we continue to use the same wing structure terminology, the Soul Pulvis and the floating Eyes that the
          extra bit near the Thumb, might be a second Thumb. Although, it could be that for Reaper-like wings that it would be a
          Finger, even though it's pointing in a different direction and isn't connected by an Arc.</p>

          <h2 id="closing">
            <strong>So what does all of this mean?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>Super theory crafting time! Let's consider everything so far:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Reaper Wings and Pig Noise Wings share similar wing structures.</li>
          <li>Minamimoto in TWEWY and the Animation can have 2 additional pairs of wings compared to regular
          Reapers.</li>
          <li>We've seen from TWEWY and the Animation that his (totally 100% normal) six wings can get messed up
          by shattering (TWEWY) or get a purple Taboo haze surround them (Animation). The Animation makes it clear that the haze is
          Taboo haze, which he gains once he gets very Taboo-ified.</li>
          <li>Minamimoto has been consuming Soul Pulvis in NEO, so it may mess up his wings again.</li>
          <li>There is a possible transformation from a Reaper Wing to a Soul Pulvis Wing.</li>
          <li>Felidae Cantus has Soul Pulvis circling around their fight.</li>
          <li>Soul Pulvis wings are very similar to the floating open Eyes that Felidae Cantus has.</li>
        </ol>
          <p>Therefore, it is possible that our mainline NEO Minamimoto has messed up wings by absorbing the Soul Pulvis, and if
          Another Day Minamimoto is an even further Soul Pulvis infused Minamimoto - and if those floating Eyes are not something
          separate or a transformed/part of a Soul Pulvis - there is a possibility that the floating Eyes are 
          <em>his wings</em>.</p>
          <p>Now there are only 3 in the fight, which is not 2 or 6. But this is a different Minamimoto. Maybe his wing growth is
          in progress. Maybe he's learning and can't convert all his Wings into Eyes. Maybe he wants the fight to be
          fair(-ish). I dunno! But let's consider a Minamimoto who grew so skilled that he could turn his wings...Into
          weapons!</p>
          <p>Anyways this was mostly an exercise in seeing how I could potentially mess up Minamimoto's Reaper wings and this
          is where it got me. If there is cool fan media of this or someone makes cool stuff based on this, feel free to send it my
          way cause I'd love to see it!</p>
