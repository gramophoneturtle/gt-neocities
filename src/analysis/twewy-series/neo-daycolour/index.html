        <p>There is a cycle from red to purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, and grey. A "reverse" rainbow with grey added in.</p>
        
        <p>It's interesting to see that colours appear in the same order. When we reach "The Last day", the seventh day, is coloured grey as expected. The next "day", "The Last day'" is also grey while "The Last day''" is red, the next colour in the cycle, which could indicate a day has passed. Or more.</p>
