<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Father looked back at the slip of paper Chisa had given him. The address should be close by, now… He didn't know what Chisa was planning, not <em>exactly</em>, though given the date the general idea was obvious. He was fully expecting Chisa to not be alone, even beside Null (who would never let her wander without supervision, he had to give them that).</p>

<p>A glance at the closest building's number told him he was only two buildings away. Curiosity made him walk a little bit faster… and then he stopped, staring in awe.</p>

<p>A cat café. Chisa (or someone else) had found a cat café he wasn't aware of.</p>

<p>He pushed the door open and was greeted by the most beautiful feline eyes looking up at him. He barely heard the door close behind him, already kneeling to gather the cat in his arms and cuddle the adorable creature.</p>

<p>Then another cat pressed against his hip, and he moved to a cross-legged position to be able to pull the new cutie in his lap.</p>

<p>Soon enough, he was the center of a pile of purring cats, and the world could as well have ceased to exist.</p>

<p>("He didn't even notice us," Chisa pouted half-heartedly from where she was sitting at a table in the corner of the café.<br>
"That was to be expected," Mother commented, though her expression clearly conveyed that, while she was aware of how Father worked, she still couldn't actually understand why.</p>

<p>The sole employee put a trail down in front of the group before staring at Father for a while.</p>

<p>"I'm used to cat lovers, but your friend is intense," she said. "Not that it is a bad thing! It's just… impressive."<br>
"He's always had a weakness to the feline," Hazuki nodded.<br>
"His awareness of his surroundings is inversely proportional to the closeness and number of cats around him," Joshua smirked. "I think we broke him."</p>

<p>The employee laughed lightly at that, and left the small group to their drinks and pastries. A silence fell over the café, only interrupted by loud purring and the occasional cooing from Father.</p>

<p>"Well, he does look happy," Null concluded.</p>

<p>Renting the café for only them for the afternoon had been a genius idea. Or maybe they'd regret it when they would have to pry Father away from his cuddle friends.</p>

<p>In the meantime everyone smiled at his radiating joy and soaked in the peace.)</p>
