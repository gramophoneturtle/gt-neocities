    - Splash card of a commission of my OCs Father and Mother as The World Ends With You styled pixel sprites by WaterPixelArt. The text in the top left says "MOTHER & FATHER". Below it is Father on the left and Mother on the right in their default standing poses. To the right, Father's sprite has his hand up and Mother has her hand outstretched with her jacket floating dramatically off her shoulders.
