<h2>Story</h2>
  
<p>"Here, Null-ren! Happy birthday!"</p>

<p>Null stared at Chisa, then at the huge ice cream she was pushing toward them. Strawberry and banana, even though they couldn't remember when they'd mentioned their preference in front of Chisa.</p>

<p>"Take it before it melts," Chisa insisted.</p>

<p>Null obeyed.</p>

<p>"Thank you, but... how did you even get it?"<br>
"I bought it," Chisa said, her expression daring them to object to <em>that</em>.<br>
"But... you don't have money?" Null asked, feeling more and more lost.</p>

<p>Wait. Of course she'd have easy access to money. Nanashi would give her anything without hesitation.</p>

<p>"I asked Mother," Chisa answered.<br>
"You really shouldn't have asked him for–" Null began before pausing abruptly as Chisa's words finally registered.</p>

<p>She grinned.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd say that if I asked Father. So I asked Mother!"</p>

<p>She looked really proud of herself, and Null couldn't help but smile.</p>

<p>"You're a crafty one, hmm?" he commented.</p>

<p>Chisa giggled, and Null relaxed.</p>

<p>She'd found really delicious ice cream.</p>
