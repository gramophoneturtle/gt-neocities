        "Digital art of my Father and Null OCs drawn as chibis by ItsAShowTime, with the artist's name added by me in the bottom right corner. Father is holding a black kitty and Null is off to the side, looking at Father with three hearts in their speech bubble. On the right side there are anime styled sketches of Father looking down at the happy kitty seriously, and Null looking to the side from a side view looking neutral or a little saddened."
