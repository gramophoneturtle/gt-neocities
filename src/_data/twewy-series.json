I don\u2019t know when Joshua would hear the story but I\n put it roughly around NEO as a part of Father trying to fix things with\n Joshua. (We\u2019ll get to the start of that another day. Given the\u2026stunt, \nJoshua tried to pull at the end of OG TWEWY.)",
    "details": "There is a bit more to this event, but Father is not sharing that \ninformation right now. The attack on the Composer was designed to cause \ndamage to the lower planes and the Composer. Because the Composer spent \nso much time with the Reapers, and taught them a lot about the planes \nand themself, it gave them the knowledge the needed to actually cause \nsignificant damage.If the attack had succeeded, and they had \ndefeated the Composer, one of them would have become the Composer and \nstill would have had to clean up their own mess. But at least it would \nhave been a functioning Composer to handle it.But instead, they \ndidn\u2019t, so the region was felt was a partially functioning Composer, \nunable to help out or transfer their power over to someone who could. \nLuckily all Reapers had the same training, so they were able to fix \nthings eventually, but not without losses.Now that knowledge \nabout the planes and the Composer\u2019s abilities is not openly shared, so \nif something similar were to happen to a Composer again, the same damage\n won\u2019t - shouldn\u2019t - be possible.And one more fun fact about the \nstory - Father was there\u2026as a Reaper. Perhaps Joshua will get to learn \nthat, and more details about those events.",

So that got me thinking, what if we had something like Parental Entities, high ranked Angels, assigned in pairs to younger Angels to help make sure they are properly adjusting to the (hivemind) Angel Society!\n\nI think it would be very interesting if Joshua had HP politics and family relations to deal with while being Composer, especially during NEO. In terms of Joshua\u2019s position as Shibuya\u2019s Composer, a potential replacement could be someone like Earrings. Someone who supports something a majority of what the HP wants (ex: say like a hivemind in the UG? Or maybe just supports Inversion?) but their methods are a bit too much for the HP (ex: forcing it to occur because Earrings is an uncommonly impatient Angel) which is why Joshua can keep his position as Shibuya\u2019s Composer despite Shibuya\u2019s state. Joshua must be a Darling Little Angel and follow the rules and not cross any lines that the elites of the HP can see that could cause him to get kicked out.\n\nBoth Mother and Father wish for Shibuya\u2019s Composer and Producer to be Good, so Joshua\u2019s Mother has been checking in on Joshua, and his Father has been watching Shibuya\u2019s Producer.
