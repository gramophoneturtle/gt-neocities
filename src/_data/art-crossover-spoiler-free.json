    "summary": "<blockquote>While everyone carries some level of Distortion, it appears that its physical manifestation is often linked to a strong surge of feelings. Predicting when one will lose their hold on their emotions might be easy, or close to impossible. However, I can see a sign of an impending rupture. It manifests as floating graffiti-like silhouettes. They are everywhere, though I am the only one to see them, but they gather around people whose Distortion is about to manifest. From my observations, they seem to be linked to the rising intensity of emotions, attracted by it and feeding it in return. As they prevent the person from regulating their feelings like they normally would, I call them Interference.</blockquote>\n<p>Commission for LetoLeGaosaure on Pillowfort / LeGaosaure@blorbo.social on Mastodon. This AU is between Distortion Detective and TWEWY, featuring Moses and the Noise. Thank you for commissioning me and providing the additional text!</p>",
