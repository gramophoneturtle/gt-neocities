    "details": "<p>The ID for the Producer in charge would allow Them to override the Composer\u2019s control. Might not be necessary depending on the power gap between the two in the UG but this method would be a guaranteed way to take over. The idea would be for emergencies, which is why Producers would be carefully chosen from the HP to make the proper judgement. I kept Hanekoma\u2019s ID as his wristwatch and made the possessing Angel\u2019s ID as earrings, mostly to keep it simple and easily visible. They need Hanekoma\u2019s ID for the plan since he\u2019s the Producer so They\u2019re using him, making both IDs visible. I like to think the RoR is designed by the HP so with permission anyone from the HP could hijack the District.</p>\n\n<p>The symbol at the bottom page 1 is based on a cat skull (but not a stylized CAT skull which I thought about using later, whoops) with a \u201cweb of bones and a hint of skulls\u201d. I had this style in mind for other HP ideas but they\u2019re on hold now so I\u2019m bringing that here cause it\u2019s a lot of fun to play around with. (If you ever stared at the bridge above the Shibuya River you might be able to make out the influence! Well and CAT\u2019s art.)</p>\n\n<p>The spreading floor pattern uses the same idea. It seemed like a cool way to visually show the Angel taking over. I was thinking They can just \u201cattach\u201d or \u201cplug\u201d themselves into the RoR like plugging cords in or something? Be able to naturally combine. Or maybe \u201cweave\u201d their wings into the \u201cfabric of Shibuya\u201d as how AD Joshua describes the RoR.</p>\n\n<p>There was a thought about visually designing an Angel instead of using Hanekoma\u2019s body (sequel I swear if we don\u2019t get more Angels\u2026) but I wasn\u2019t in the mood for it. Hopefully with the idea of using IDs as described above and possession/using his form it doesn\u2019t seem too odd to use Hanekoma.</p>\n\n<p>And how does the HP feel about this? I like to believe They\u2019re against this. Too much intervention, even if it works out. They\u2019re divided on what They should do with this \u201clost\u201d world. Do They descend and apprehend the Fallen Angels? (Was thinking there\u2019s a small(?) group of them doing this.) Or do They sit back, observe and report to other worlds that aren\u2019t a lost cause? And if it\u2019s the second option, are there other Angels that oppose that and interfere? Maybe some Producers neighbouring Shibuya, perhaps?</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cNo one has ever accused Angels of being in a hurry.\u201d Hah! We\u2019ve got plenty of \u201cShibuya\"s so let\u2019s experiment! If we break one, we\u2019ll just let the Composer fix it, since he loves Shibuya so, so much!</em></p>",

He also offers Neku his knowledge of \nComposer things, whatever overlap their worlds may have (which is like \nall of it except whatever rules Neku decided to change\u2026something I \nremembered he can do), since Neku is oddly lacking in Composer \nknowledge.Joshua only does this to help pass time and to keep \nNeku sane, cause if the Composer becomes more unstable, then so does the\n world, meaning Joshua\u2019s chances of surviving go down.
