It think\n it\u2019s her eyes/eye colour that we\u2019re missing? (Pre NEO.) And not really \nshowing Joshua\u2019s wings. (Which is new if you ignore DDD.) The Composer \nstyle too is sorta shown\u2026 we have blurry Composer to maybe show how \nMegumi perceives him, and then we get a glimpse at how Hanekoma sees \nhim, but only the feet/lower legs which is more defined. It\u2019s \ninteresting.I think aside from possibly not \u201cspoiling\u201d stuff for \nNEO, Tin Pin Joshua sums it up nicely. Maybe they\u2019re trying to stick to \nthe original material - don\u2019t show Shiki\u2019s eyes and only give you bits \nof the Composer form.There\u2019s a couple of variations cause I love \nchains & Composer imagery, even though that\u2019s not the point here, \nand Shiki looked really plain without something compared to the Composer\n (so many effects!!) so a Mr. Mew pattern was the only thing I could \nthink of that I could use to show obscuring Shiki\u2019s identity.",

It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sure They found it interesting and learned a lot about it afterwards.\n\nI don\u2019t have any major plans for a Composer Sho AU but hey if Hanekoma is looking to break (out of) the Higher Plane, this might be the Composer to do it, provided Sho can be a passable Composer for his UG duties in the meantime. Maybe over time grows to enjoy and excel at it too. I feel like he could toe the line between messing with the HP but not enough for the HP to get rid of him, since he\u2019s had to put up with Officer duties before, Sho knows how to balance that out. Sho would also be fascinated with the HP and might even \u201cwork with\u201d Them more than Composers normally would and that could a point in his favour for having the HP risk keeping him around. (What is normal anyways.)\n\nSho probably wouldn\u2019t call Hanekoma \u201cFeathers\u201d, but what if similar to Megs for Megumi, he takes the \u201cHane\u201d of \u201cHanekoma\u201d which can mean \u201cfeather\u201d and uses that as a nickname? I like the nickname but I can\u2019t think of anyone but Sho would use that. Maybe Composer!Beat, if spun in positively?\n\nThe orange gradient is to make him similar to the HP colour scheme I use, since I feel like he would interested in Them. He leans towards orange/yellows, while the HP is orange/red. Other options are deep blue/purple (but somehow different from Neku) or\u2026 black\u2026 which isn\u2019t really an option. I guess I could make his colour subdued to show he\u2019s not really great as a Composer in the UG sense? I dunno. Might still mess with his gradient.",

    "details": "<p>The ID for the Producer in charge would allow Them to override the Composer\u2019s control. Might not be necessary depending on the power gap between the two in the UG but this method would be a guaranteed way to take over. The idea would be for emergencies, which is why Producers would be carefully chosen from the HP to make the proper judgement. I kept Hanekoma\u2019s ID as his wristwatch and made the possessing Angel\u2019s ID as earrings, mostly to keep it simple and easily visible. They need Hanekoma\u2019s ID for the plan since he\u2019s the Producer so They\u2019re using him, making both IDs visible. I like to think the RoR is designed by the HP so with permission anyone from the HP could hijack the District.</p>\n\n<p>The symbol at the bottom page 1 is based on a cat skull (but not a stylized CAT skull which I thought about using later, whoops) with a \u201cweb of bones and a hint of skulls\u201d. I had this style in mind for other HP ideas but they\u2019re on hold now so I\u2019m bringing that here cause it\u2019s a lot of fun to play around with. (If you ever stared at the bridge above the Shibuya River you might be able to make out the influence! Well and CAT\u2019s art.)</p>\n\n<p>The spreading floor pattern uses the same idea. It seemed like a cool way to visually show the Angel taking over. I was thinking They can just \u201cattach\u201d or \u201cplug\u201d themselves into the RoR like plugging cords in or something? Be able to naturally combine. Or maybe \u201cweave\u201d their wings into the \u201cfabric of Shibuya\u201d as how AD Joshua describes the RoR.</p>\n\n<p>There was a thought about visually designing an Angel instead of using Hanekoma\u2019s body (sequel I swear if we don\u2019t get more Angels\u2026) but I wasn\u2019t in the mood for it. Hopefully with the idea of using IDs as described above and possession/using his form it doesn\u2019t seem too odd to use Hanekoma.</p>\n\n<p>And how does the HP feel about this? I like to believe They\u2019re against this. Too much intervention, even if it works out. They\u2019re divided on what They should do with this \u201clost\u201d world. Do They descend and apprehend the Fallen Angels? (Was thinking there\u2019s a small(?) group of them doing this.) Or do They sit back, observe and report to other worlds that aren\u2019t a lost cause? And if it\u2019s the second option, are there other Angels that oppose that and interfere? Maybe some Producers neighbouring Shibuya, perhaps?</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cNo one has ever accused Angels of being in a hurry.\u201d Hah! We\u2019ve got plenty of \u201cShibuya\"s so let\u2019s experiment! If we break one, we\u2019ll just let the Composer fix it, since he loves Shibuya so, so much!</em></p>",

    "details": "<p>I\u2019m planning to use anything HP related for playing around with styles and designs and I want to experiment with, all which is probably the opposite direction of we\u2019ll maybe get one day. Mainly this is using stronger contrasts with light and shadow and leaning into the more formal and scientific tone of the secret reports.</p>\n<p>I wanted red tinged shadows for whatever colour scheme I settled on which seems to be autumn or amber. I chose darker tones to contrast with the imagery of \u201cAngels\u201d, \u201cAscending\u201d, \u201cHigher Plane\u201d, etc.. Maybe it was once bright and vibrant but over time it slowly shifted to something darker and dimmer. Without planning it, this reminds me the dim Room of Reckoning and I wonder if shifts similarly based on the UG/Composer\u2026or if it\u2019s also strongly connected to the HP.</p>\n<p>In addition to the colour scheme, the edges of perception are darker/less defined. I like the style on it\u2019s own but with TWEWY\u2019s style it\u2019s another variation of the streaky borders. I\u2019ve played around a bit before with using TWEWY borders as a way to show separation of planes/perception and I might start leaning into it more.</p>\n<p>Clothing/accessory wise I wanted change Hanekoma\u2019s sunglasses to glasses and shift his clothes into something lab coat or formal like. And maybe do something with his watch. But he\u2019ll keep his sandals.

But for now\u2026why not just toss them on the same \u201clevel\u201d as the RG and UG? They can have their own HP only locations and spaces but for part of it\u2026I\u2019m just going to layer it right on top.</p>",

    "details": "<p>Original Notes.</p>\n<p>I think the pad could be a mix of both the Composer and the Conductor\u2019s design, and maybe a bit of the GMs? Like others can bring stuff in but it\u2019s ultimately the Composer\u2019s say whether something stays or not? I always felt Joshua\u2019s pad was weird so I wondered if maybe it was a joint thing?</p>\n<p>Josh sinking into the couch was entirely for fun but as I thought about it, Neku can probably alter his environment which can result in exactly this situation. (Or the couch sinks more than you expect it to, as they do)We really don\u2019t know what Joshua is like outside of week 2 so I thought I\u2019d play with that. He\u2019s trying not to antagonize this world\u2019s Composer, and while it\u2019s not shown here, I think Neku would ignore and/or get extremely annoyed if Joshua reminded him of week 2 Joshua. Anyways, I mostly wanted to see a relaxed Joshua who\u2019s not trying to overly antagonize Neku, but he still keeps this world\u2019s Composer\u2019s issues in mind.</p>\n<p>Style wise I think I\u2019ll use gradients give the Composers some colour but to also indicate the influence/authority(?) the Composer has at the time. I\u2019ve considered their glow and auras to help indicate this but I only played with the glow here. Joshua being glowy on the first page was done before I thought of this and and I kept it entirely because of I really liked how it lookedI 1000% made up the special noise thing.</p>\n<p>Just thought it would be neat if something threatening was lurking in the aquarium floors/walls</p>",
