The Composer \nstyle too is sorta shown\u2026 we have blurry Composer to maybe show how \nMegumi perceives him, and then we get a glimpse at how Hanekoma sees \nhim, but only the feet/lower legs which is more defined. It\u2019s \ninteresting.I think aside from possibly not \u201cspoiling\u201d stuff for \nNEO, Tin Pin Joshua sums it up nicely. Maybe they\u2019re trying to stick to \nthe original material - don\u2019t show Shiki\u2019s eyes and only give you bits \nof the Composer form.There\u2019s a couple of variations cause I love \nchains & Composer imagery, even though that\u2019s not the point here, \nand Shiki looked really plain without something compared to the Composer\n (so many effects!!) so a Mr. Mew pattern was the only thing I could \nthink of that I could use to show obscuring Shiki\u2019s identity.",
