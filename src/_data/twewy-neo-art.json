There could be an Imagination requirement to see the Soul Pulvis which fits for why Rindo, Minamimoto, Beat and Neku can see them. (Rindo\u2019s might be because of his pin I don\u2019t feel like digging through the SR.)\nDoes this mean I\u2019ll be using this form for Angels? Probably or at least occasionally.",
