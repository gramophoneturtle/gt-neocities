    "details": "The Composer versions are actual redraws but for the human forms I just drew on top of the anime screenshots cause I was feeling lazy and wanted to try and keep the anime feel. I thought it might be easier but honestly I don\u2019t think it was because of the gradients they use on top.\n\nTagging @rainbow-nijisaki (Tumblr) and @black-quadrant (Tumblr) since apparently we were all thinking of anime NEO Joshua about the same time. I was doing Composer form redraws from anime screenshots when the redraws were first posted by rainbow-nijisaki, (so if you like these and you haven\u2019t seen those ones, please go check them out!) which inspired me to try some human NEO Joshuas. I guess we had anime related Joshuas on the mind!",

There could be an Imagination requirement to see the Soul Pulvis which fits for why Rindo, Minamimoto, Beat and Neku can see them. (Rindo\u2019s might be because of his pin I don\u2019t feel like digging through the SR.)\nDoes this mean I\u2019ll be using this form for Angels? Probably or at least occasionally.",
