(For whatever good it will do, but he did try to warn them!)</p>\n\n<p>Then he has a chat with Coco and Minamimoto outside and away from Kaie\u2019s shop. There\u2019s some choice words from Coco about where Hanekoma has been the past three years and lecturing from Hanekoma to them about their aims towards the Higher Plane, the dangers of Minamimoto absorbing dangerous and unknown things, and the effect of Coco\u2019s sigil on Minamimoto.</p>\n\n<p>Then there\u2019s talk about getting Minamimoto his proper body back, not some \u201ccleaned up\u201d version that Minamimoto has now due to Coco\u2019s copying of the sigil. (He\u2019s missing one whisker!! And perhaps some cool tattoos. Ones that aren\u2019t actual(?) taboo. We don\u2019t need overloaded taboo Minamimoto again.) A combined version of what he had before and now might be the form Minamimoto wants.</p>\n\n<p>While Hanekoma and Coco bicker about who will be involved with drawing the sigil and how they will\u2026destroy\u2026Minamimoto\u2019s current body (can\u2019t revive something that already exists) Minamimoto decides to take the second half into his own hands and for one reason or another - maybe he tries to tune into a higher plane that he can\u2019t exist in, conduct an experiment, maybe he just blows himself up (as you do) - he destroys his own body, again, leaving Coco and Hanekoma to revive Minamimoto.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the sigil you can kinda see on the ground with some draft details and labelling Hanekoma and Coco\u2019s sides. Not everything is aligned properly but it was good enough for this drawing.</p>\n\n<p>Since Coco allows Hanekoma to help her with the sigil (probably because she doesn\u2019t quite remember it but she\u2019s not going to admit that) so they split the work up. A fun idea that came up during stream and chats afterwards was what if Coco used her colours of green and pink/purple? (Would that affect anything?) Would Hanekoma lecture her on improper tool usage, if that\u2019s a thing? Did Coco mess up pi\u2019s digits? Are her fundamentals poor?</p>\n\n<p>Whatever it is, Coco would appreciate any feedback with less snark.</p>\n\n<p>A pretty neat sigil break down can be found in this fic, Postmortem Analysis, which gave me a great starting point as to what the sigil contained.</p>",

Joshua contacted Shiki to get the cushion hand made, so Father can sense this cushion is constructed a bit differently, perhaps similar to how the original Mr. Mew was compared to say, Mr. Mew dolls that would be sold at stores. Joshua did not disclose who the cushion was for, and perhaps some day down the line, she might find out.</p>\n<p>But anyways, this is totally not a gift, just something Joshua doesn\u2019t want back, and definitely not given on a particular day whatsoever.
