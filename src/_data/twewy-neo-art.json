    "summary": "What if the glowy Composer form is just a higher vibe frequency form? Kubo gets an earthy colour palette from his talking panel backgrounds, colour scheme and intro card. Soul Pulvis gradient was for contrast and a warmer association to their in game colour.",
    "details": "This was just going to be \u201cregular\u201d Kubo with the Soul Pulvis but as I started working on the birds I was like, wait a sec, there was a reason why I thought the birds were Composer related in the demo with their aura and greyscale design.\n\nSince some people can see the Soul Pulvis, maybe it\u2019s similar to how lesser Reapers can\u2019t perceive the Composer. There could be an Imagination requirement to see the Soul Pulvis which fits for why Rindo, Minamimoto, Beat and Neku can see them. (Rindo\u2019s might be because of his pin I don\u2019t feel like digging through the SR.)\nDoes this mean I\u2019ll be using this form for Angels? Probably or at least occasionally.",
