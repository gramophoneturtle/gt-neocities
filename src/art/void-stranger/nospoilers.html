description: Mostly crossover art between Super Puzzled Cat and Dunvin's SpindaTuber adventures. Found the game in 2024(?) and after a streamer got to a certain point in the game I NEEDED to know what the game had in store. It's a difficult game and at times cruel game, but it lives rent free in my head.
