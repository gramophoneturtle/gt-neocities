Title: Mikan's Koi Fish Adventure
Characters: 
  - "Father"
  - "Mikan"
---

### Summary
In TWEWY, there’s the Dead God’s Pad where there’s a giant floor fish aquarium. I had joked a while back on stream, what if Shibuya’s Composer decided to name the fish for fun, like after some of their favourite Reapers, other Composers or Mother and Father?

So I extended that idea for when Father was a Reaper under Composer Null. What if Null had a koi fish pond in their “Dead God’s Pad”? What if Father heard the Composer naming the koi fish, and decided to name one after Chisa, after she lost her Soul to the Void?

Also the name Father went as during his Reaper days is Fuyuto. The kanji for it means “winter” and “ascension”. Winter for his birthday and ascension for all the rising up he needs to do.

(Also what if he owned an orange cat with white socks and nose and maybe belly and what if he decided to get an orange coat with white tassels in the modern day ANYWAYS - )

### Story

The moment he entered the Composer's garden, Mikan who had previously been relaxed and content in Fuyuto's arms, suddenly squirmed out and darted towards the koi pond.

"Wait, Mikan!" He clumsily stumbled after the cat. He caught up to her just in time to see her walking along the rocky edge of the pond and relaxed when he saw the koi fish were away in this strange, supernatural pond. Only the calm water and rocky bottom below the water's surface could be seen.

He absolutely will not allow Mikan to harm the koi fish, even though he's certain she probably can't. Even so, she dare not touch Lil' Chisa, there will be no exceptions! He watched Mikan settled down by the pond, her bright orange fur standing out from the greenery, dull rocks and the reflecting blue of the water from the sky. She was ready to nap, taken over by the calm of the koi pond.

He supposes as long as he keeps an eye on her, it'll be fine. He made sure she was fed, but be knows cats don't care about being fed to play with creatures they shouldn't. He sits down next to her and waits for the Conductor to arrive.

Fuyuto is pulled out of his thoughts as Mikan suddenly jumped beside him. His eyes are wide and alert now, heart pounding and afraid that maybe he missed that Mikan attacked one of the -

But no. A large shiny golden koi fish had surfaced and had nibbled at Mikan's one white paw that had been dangling over the pond ledge. It seemed interested in Mikan, and Mikan seemed equally intrigued by it in return. She didn't appear ready to attack as she couched back down cautiously by the pond edge, but he kept himself poised to intervene if he needed to. As the koi fish kept trying to nibble at her paw, she would pulled it back, only to lightly poke back at the fish.

It continued for a while until she decided to try and sniff the koi fish. The koi fish did the same as it had been, and this time gave her a kiss on her nose. She snapped back and scrunched her head back into her body.

He rolled his eyes. Relatable, but how could you not see that coming?

However, she didn't retreat but instead laid right back down by the pond. This time no paw or face crossed over into the koi pond waters. She stretched out and continued to watch the fish.

She must have forgotten about her tail, as it hung just above the surface of the water. Another koi fish, this one orange and white, appeared from the reflections of the water and nipped her tail.

Mikan merely flicked her tail away and lifted her head up to watch the new fishy friend. Slowly she lowered her head back down, only moving it from side to side to watch the other koi fish as they also suddenly reappeared in the pond. He spotted the Lil' Chisa koi fish among them, thankfully still there. He smiled and finally lets himself relax once more.
