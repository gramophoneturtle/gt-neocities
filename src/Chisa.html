    <h2 class="c9" id="h.vfw5ibo00byr"><span class="c5">Risks</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Choosing Chisa is foolish emotionally.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Practically, it&#39;s the most logical. They have enough of her data to try and find
            her. Reasonably, the team would have this amount of information to work with.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the future they could have more access. But this is a test scenario they would
            need to come across anyways.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Emotionally? If Null fails, then she could be gone. Forever. Which is what is
            currently believed.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">If Null fails, but succeeded later with another equally likely Soul&hellip;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nanshi already hates them, so there&#39;s really nothing more to lose.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Except for how Null would feel.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">But they know, Chisa would be the strongest motivator for them to succeed the first
            time. Because, every Soul deserves a chance. Why should another Soul have priority over another?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">But then why should Chisa&#39;s Soul be first?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">They could bounce around questions all day but, there&#39;s also&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>If Null is successful, what would they do when Chisa </span><span class="c13">asks?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Because any Soul would ask about their family.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Null can tell her of her human Father, her brother, and anything about her
            family&#39;s descendants. She could find that out if she chose to stay in the higher planes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">But how would Null approach the topic of her Angel Father? Her transitioned
            Father?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Even if Null were to tell her in the most ideal and fair way possible, what about
            telling Nanashi? When should he know? </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">And he will know, if it gets to that point. Because another point for using Chisa as
            an early test is because they have a wealth of ways to verify her stability with her and her Father&#39;s
            interactions. It goes both ways.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">While memories of the other may fade and may not always remember things the same way,
            there is authenticity they can study.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Even if Nanashi rejects her, he would still see her (forced even, Null doesn&#39;t
            want to think about that). And from that alone they could gain a huge amount of data.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.g4v3jnkmt8l0"><span class="c5">To the Dust</span></h2>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">What does Null have to lose?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">They could be erased and no one would miss them as they are now. What is missed is
            who they were and who they could be once again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>They miss their </span><span class="c13">Name</span><span class="c2">.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">It is disrespectful to not call someone by Name or Title. Nevermind by one&#39;s
            Signature ID.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">His last partner has moved on. To live in two different circles, to risk inviting
            dissonance into their partner&#39;s Soul&hellip; they know it. They feel it too.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was awkward to refer to someone without doing so directly. For Null, and who they
            knew. Perhaps, for another being, that would be perfect for them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">But that&#39;s not Null.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">They miss a way to address them that doesn&#39;t inflict punishment on Null and the
            one addressing Null.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Even Null doesn&#39;t miss the way their Parents address them. Rather, how they
            don&#39;t.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">And to call their once Composer by Composer is too distant for them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">And some Voided Researcher is worse.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">So they don&#39;t. And &quot;Null&quot; is not a name. It&#39;s not even a nickname.
            It is a way to refer to them. To try and register another Name just becomes one less way they can be
            referred to.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">It&#39;s always, always the same way&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;You may refer to me as Null.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">They say this to the first fragment of Chisa&#39;s Soul. Probably before she could
            even understand.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.6foqt0qnydol"><span class="c5">Null</span></h2>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">And yet..</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Null?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of anyone with a name like that before.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s not a name. It&#39;s a way to refer to me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I don&#39;t have a name.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Null knows if people believe it&#39;s a name, then it becomes a Name.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Why not?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">What do they say?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s&hellip;complicated.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I can help you find one!&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">She&#39;s so sweet. Any child can be. Anyone can be.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her innocence is warm and it hurts.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Maybe one day. But for now, can you refer to me as Null?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">She nods. &quot;OK. Noll!&quot; She stumbles over the name.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">She frowns.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Noull. Null. Null!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">She smiles at them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">And they can&#39;t stop their own smile in response.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nor would they want to.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Surely you could clamp down on that too?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;We could, but they do need a way to move forward. Otherwise what is the
            point?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Father muses. To refer to another that is not quite a name. Alternative methods work
            but show disrespect to their former Composer.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Father nods as if his approval was required.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes, I suppose they do need some sign of hope. It&#39;s good for the

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">When they first hear that, they&#39;re not sure what they&#39;re feeling.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, &#39;ren&#39; is short for parent. So, well,&quot; she looks embarrassed
            and Null feels it too.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">They&#39;re like&hellip;her parent? They never thought, how, why would she - ?</span>

    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Null-Ren&rsquo;, she had called them.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Is that okay?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Y-yes.&quot; They stammer. &quot;But, no. You, you can refer to me as
            Null-Ren.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">They have to make that clear. They have to.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Oh Lords above he will protect this. He will succeed. They will make sure they do

    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Even if she no longer wants to use &quot;Null-Ren&quot;...</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">To even be referred to as Null&hellip;! To use and like it!</span></p>

    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">No, this was fine. They will have this moment. Even a Fallen, working towards a

    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>It grows the Soul. It&#39;s good for it.</span></p>

    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And a one-two~&quot; he sing-songs as he half bounces the kitty from under
            their upper arm pits twice. Then he lifts up the kitty&#39;s right side high enough so that the right back
            leg is lifted up and it can be &quot;stepped&quot; forward. &quot;And a three-four~&quot; two more little
            bounces before the left hind leg is lifted up and forward. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He continues this, the cat seemingly fine with this arrangement, as the pair continue

    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most people along the street could only afford to glance briefly at the pair before
            hurriedly looking away and continuing their journey for not wanting to look rude. Even those who normally
            would pull out their phone to snap a picture or a video felt a weird, unexplained discouragement from doing
            so. However, two of the onlookers continued watching the duo from across the street, where they had stopped
            once they realized they had lost their traveling companion.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chisa&#39;s eyes flash to a brilliant green as she glares daggers at the &quot;silly
            witty kibby&quot; getting &quot;special treatment&quot; while Null stares rather blankly at the
            whole...spectacle. They had heard of Nanashi&#39;s unusual... adoration... of cats. But this was something
            else. There was a special openness and joy that radiated from his Soul, that Null is not honestly certain
            they have ever felt so strongly from the Angel.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was...understandable, given the point in their lives they had both met, but it
            didn&#39;t reduce the sharp pang in their Soul that echoed out faintly against their will. Even the moments
            of joy he had expressed during his time as a Reaper felt so dull and muted compared to what Null was seeing
            now.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were pulled out of their thoughts when their hand was gripped tightly. They look
            down at Chisa and meet a reflection of his eye colour back at him. There&#39;s hurt and jealousy in her eyes
            that Null bit back against the burning question if she ever felt that from her Father when he was
            alive.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Null squeezes her hand back tightly and gives her a small smile. There&rsquo;s a hint
            of sadness in there, perhaps of isolation, that they didn&#39;t want to hide from her. Chisa leans more into
            their side and turns her gaze back to her Father and the cat, who have made rather... considerable progress
            down the shops. Almost down to the end of the street.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lost in his own little world, with a random fuzzy feline passerby.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s go, Null-Ren,&quot; Chisa mumbles, looking down at her feet. &quot;He
            knows where to find us.&quot; She squeezes Null&#39;s hand tighter as she tugs at their hand to get the two
            of them to move away.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.cl1dvgo8ojaq"><span>To Melt the Pain, You Need Cold</span></h2>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ice cream?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sure.&quot; Chisa doesn&#39;t bother trying to sound excited. Ice cream
            isn&#39;t going to help. Holding Null-Ren&#39;s hand is comforting, but it&#39;s not the hand she wants to
            hold right now. Not that she wanted to before, but since with that hand-thieving-brat came by and her Father
            decide to make the furball &quot;walk&quot; like some child and -</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I know a good mint ice cream store nearby. They even let you mix in whatever
            you want.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Really?&quot; She asks a little suspiciously. She looks up at Null-Ren as they
            begin to lead the way to the ice cream store. &quot;But, do they have strawberry and banana?&quot; If the
            store doesn&#39;t have Null-Ren&#39;s favourite flavour, then it&#39;s not a good ice cream store.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Really. And they do. Well, in some fashion.&quot; Chisa frowns but before she
            can speak, they continue with a growing smile, &quot;Of course, they must stock the ingredients to mix in.
            You can&#39;t just bring in your own.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh.&quot; Chisa isn&#39;t sure whether this is something to be disappointed
            about or expected. Why even bring it up?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">With barely a moment to that thought, Null-Ren stops walking and Chisa bumps into
            their side.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And here we are!&quot; Null-Ren makes a sweeping gesture with their free arm at
            the very &#39;I am an Ice Cream Store&#39; decorated place in front them. There doesn&#39;t seem to be too
            many customers in line but many are sitting in the store and enjoying their ice cream, kids and adults
            both.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;re already here?&quot; Chisa blinks a few extra times to be
            certain.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Null-Ren chuckles softly. &quot;Blink and you miss the walk.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chisa&#39;s heart sank at the realization that Null-Ren must have warped the space
            around them to get here faster. Null-Ren knows she doesn&#39;t like to cheat! </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;re not in Shibuya anymore, are we?&quot; She keeps her voice as steady
            as possible. Null-Ren is trying, really trying, to lift her spirits. Hers and their own. She bites her lower
            lip and tries not to grip Null-Ren&#39;s hand harder. She fights back tears that really shouldn&#39;t be
            here right now. Cheating doesn&#39;t normally bother her this much.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">But, her </span><span class="c8">Father</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;being,
            well...</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She swallows and buries the rest of the thought.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, we aren&#39;t.&quot; A bit of tiredness creeps into their voice. But when
            they walk forward and push open the door with their free hand, the shop bell chiming brightly, they smile at
            her so gently that she can&#39;t really blame them for wanting to warp them away.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She squeezes their hand back gently as she tries to smile. She can&#39;t hide the
            tears - she hasn&#39;t cried! But they&#39;re still there, at the corner of her eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">Null-Ren doesn&#39;t comment. Chisa can&#39;t imagine them not noticing, since they
            have a caring heart. But Chisa is grateful. She doesn&#39;t need anyone overreacting, unlike a certain
            someone </span><span class="c8">who they are not supposed to be thinking about</span><span
            class="c0">.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, show me what I can mix in!&quot; Chisa walks past Null-Ren and pulls them
            into the line. She&#39;s here now, with Null-Ren, getting ice cream.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her cheer is a little forced but she wants to try and make it real. For her. For
            Null-Ren. Because right now, they are here, together, getting ice cream.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re going to do.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.3silgbimsffs"><span>You Get One(?)</span></h2>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Annnd here we are!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He releases his hold from the cat&#39;s upper torso and with a soft &#39;plop!&#39;,
            their front paws hit the pavement. The cat stumbles their first steps forward, adjusting to having four paws
            to work with again. They turn their head to look up at the Angel with a cautious expression, still not
            entirely sure what to make of their recent adventure.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Did you have fun?&quot; Father asks in a half amused tone. His hands are back
            in his pockets, the lingering warmth and soft fur and flesh still fresh in his mind. The cat sniffs the air,
            picking up scents, and using their other senses again that they couldn&#39;t while they were preoccupied
            with their walk. The cat does one final scan around the area, then back up at the Angel, and then quickly
            walks away.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Goodbye little fluffy creature! May you live another day.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Or don&#39;t. Life is life, afterall. And so, is &quot;death&quot;.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">His mind flickers back and around to what he was doing before his walk. The silence
            and absence of familiar company is instantly felt and it tells him he is now alone. He looks around anyways
            for Chisa and Null, knowing full well neither of them are there. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it felt good to look. The spin on his shoes, the whirl of his ponytail and
            feathered tassels flying around. All for him alone to feel and for strangers to see.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least he was trying.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">Apparently, they didn&#39;t approve of his cat break and just took off! It
            wasn&#39;t difficult to ping their location - Father is the one in charge of them both, the highest rank out
            of them all - and </span><span class="c8">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;because Null has essentially
            stamped their location for him to find so easily. His upper lip twitches at the distance Null took Chisa
            away, but it&#39;s expectedly still within Father&#39;s Region so there&#39;s no issue. It would be a
            surprise if Null had broken the rules, given their precarious standing in the Higher Plane.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He begins to wander generally in the ice cream shop&#39;s direction. Taking his time,
            giving them both time.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He probably wasn&#39;t wanted anyways. He didn&#39;t truly expect everything to go
            smoothly with Chisa, but every mistake drives home how truly awful of a parent he is to Chisa.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least Joshua and CAT didn&#39;t abandon him during cat breaks. Sometimes CAT would
            even join him, if only to amuse him. Not the greatest, Father could only admit privately to himself, but at
            least there was an attempt.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reia would be a perfect cat companion, but cats could probably sense that Classified
            Something Else she carried and rejected her. It&#39;s not unusual for cats to reject Angels or even Reapers
            if they can&#39;t make themselves appealing to the sensitive creatures. But Father has introduced enough
            Angels to cats to know that the cats were unsettled by that Something Else.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He never told Reia, but he never hid that suspicion. He couldn&#39;t really say one
            or the other because it fell under Classified Information. Information he shouldn&#39;t have, and maybe,
            shouldn&#39;t be aware of in the first place.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">He had hoped that Chisa would love cats. Then he could have wonderful
            Father-Daughter bonding activities with cats! But, somehow, he messed that up when the first cat she met
            attacked her and </span><span class="c8">apparently</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;he was supposed to protect
            her! It was just a warning swipe and honestly she must have seen it coming - the cat was tense, eyes
            narrowed, and all those cat-is-going-to-swipe warning signs on display!</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her life was not in danger and even Chisa agreed with him! Null was being the
            overprotective one. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He rolls his eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">So where did he go wrong? Why was caring about the cat a little more over Chisa such
            a bad thing? Seeing how Null was instantly at her side, Father wouldn&#39;t put it past Null to also
            eviscerate the cat too. Someone had to keep an eye out for the defenseless cat.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He frowns and digs his thumb into his index finger.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a foul mood. If he&#39;s honest, he&#39;s not sure how to fix it. But he really
            doesn&#39;t *have* to.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">[Mood, Father. Mood. &hellip;Hmm. &quot;Fun&quot; idea.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also - some adjustment here.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">]</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The shop&#39;s bells chime harshly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">In the most negative sense, he </span><span class="c8">is</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;right. Chisa, much less Null, doesn&#39;t have to like him. She wants to live among the
            humans once she has passed her tests and examination, so she won&#39;t even remember him anyways.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he will be the one to remember how she feels about him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">His eyes roam over the shelves of odd toys and collectables - all from a time he is
            and is not a part of.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">She rejected him, even &quot;</span><span class="c8">Null-ren&quot;</span><span
            class="c0">, for a future life with humans. He knows why. Understands why. It only lessens the pain.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dolls judge him as he passes by them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s fine. After what he did? What he didn&#39;t do?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The free disc spins around the ring with a half satisfying whirl. Lights catch on the
            main body in an oddly mesmerizing way, but not too distracting.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He really doesn&#39;t have to fix it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He smiles sweetly at the cashier as he slides the money over.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sunlight is harsh outside. His coat weighs heavier than before, and not from the
            sunlight, but from the ring in his pocket.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.epi9zzcyy1k7"><span>If You Don&#39;t Know</span></h2>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&#39;t give her the ring when they met up again. He walked into a coffee shop,
            with a clearer head this time, and found some treats she might have liked. Null too, for the heck of
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would like to say it was smart but -</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We, um&hellip;&quot; Chisa apologizes after her shock at his offer of the
            treats. &quot;We just had ice cream.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right. Of course.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Null only raises an eyebrow at him and says nothing. Not a hint of amusement or
            disappointment or anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, no sense in offering Null&#39;s theirs. So he smiles and made up some probably
            smooth remark about how he would handle it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">His mind was focused on the ring, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to offer it.
            Chisa didn&#39;t wear jewelry, and not that this was specifically for fashion, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He let it lie.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a day. Or two. Vented to Reia. And then -</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What is that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He pauses and studies Chisa. Unable to read any strong intrigue about the ring in his
            hands, he offers it to her without a word. She takes it and flips it over. The scrutiny, confusion, and lack
            of fascination in it is clear as day that she doesn&#39;t find it even slightly interesting even when she
            spins the disc around the ring.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She doesn&#39;t even try it on.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What do you think of it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s&hellip;um&hellip;unique.&quot; She hands it back to him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">So polite. He sighs. At least he checked first.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Father&hellip;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">&quot;If your &#39;mask&#39; isn&#39;t working, try another. Or, try none. If
            it&#39;s going that poorly for you. You can afford it, can&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reia&hellip; </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I wanted to get you something.&quot; His voice is a little flat. Not
            intentionally so. It just is. Tiredness is probably what it really is, but he wishes it wasn&#39;t there.
            &quot;Got this thing without really thinking it through. Even when I did think, I still didn&#39;t know
            what.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He fiddles with the ring. He&#39;s looking at it, not at Chisa. He pauses briefly
            because part of him wants to smile and say what a fool of an idea it was and swap topics. He doesn&#39;t
            want to hear and see more disappointment. Rejection.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So much has changed, Chisa. The world, has changed.&quot; She has changed,
            naturally, from the years he wasn&#39;t there. And, well, &#39;unnaturally&#39; perhaps, from a Soul being
            Voided. And then reassembled by a stranger who probably knows her inside and out and pretends they don&#39;t
            already know. &quot;The things that I did don&#39;t have the same impact. Mend your clothes? We do that now.
            Even as a human, it&#39;s better to go to a professional depending on the damage. Cook you a meal? When did
            we last eat? Buy you your favourite treats?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c8">You&#39;ve got ice cream now</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;he bites back.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ah.&quot; She understands.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He thought the hardest part would be for her to accept him as a father now instead of
            a mother. And that everything would come back naturally as she adjusted.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&#39;s not the only one. Something frightening wraps around his wrists and hands,
            making it harder to flicker the ring&rsquo;s spinner calmly. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He also needs to adjust. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Being a Father to Angels in a world where it&#39;s more of a Role than a bond -
            biological or not - and in a world where thoughts and feelings blend and mix in such a way that many surface
            level feelings are so clearly understood on a natural level.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Chisa was human and wishes to become one again. Her thoughts are locked more
            naturally because of her status but he imagines if she were forced to become an Angel, she might fall under
            the more secretive types.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&hellip;just don&#39;t know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that was that. He spilled out how he failed her. How he couldn&#39;t do this
            simple, simple thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She should go.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead, she sits down beside him heavily. She looks up. Probably biting her lip. He
            can see her fingers twist among themselves in his peripheral vision. If he let his senses scan he could have
            all his questions answered.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Almost all his questions answered. Even so, he doesn&#39;t want to know what he
            already expected. Rejection.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">But sitting down next to him didn&#39;t seem the start of it unless she knew of what
        </span><span class="c8">he</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;could be like now. He hid </span><span
            class="c8">that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from her. She&#39;ll probably find out one day but&hellip;
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He zeros back in on the useless ring. Spin. Spin.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&hellip;&quot; the small word was so powerful, freezing his movements,
            locked onto every little waver in her voice. &quot;You can ask, you know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He doesn&#39;t dare say anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She continues carefully, slowly, &quot;Null-ren, asks me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I should know.&quot; He finally mutters. Spits out bitterly. Something like
            that.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But, you just said, so much has changed.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They should already know.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She brittles. &quot;It&#39;s&hellip; It&#39;s still&hellip; nice&hellip; that they
            ask.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A silence stretches and with every beat he feels his Soul tremble more. He knows, he
            knows what he should say and do right now. She handed the script to him and all he had to do was say
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&#39;s probably staring at him, expectantly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He squeezes the ring. Useless as it was physically, it was still important to
            him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t think, just speak.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What&hellip; would you like, Chisa?&quot; He should be looking at her, but he
            can&#39;t. His next words were maybe too much but they come out anyways. &quot;Anything you want to
            buy?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if they had to worry about money, but he would &#39;cheat&#39; as little as he
            could for Chisa, no matter how much it might inconvenience him. Maybe if it could be reasonably handmade, he
            could acquire the materials and make it himself, if he had the natural skills to do so, and not mimic an
            expert&#39;s steps.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Anything you want to do?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He waits. And waits. He said what he was supposed to right? Chisa wanted him to ask,
            so she must have what she wanted to say ready&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did he mess this up too?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He slowly looks up at her. He notices the fidgeting hands have moved up to fiddle
            with Null&#39;s - her - scarf, her eyes flickering from place to place, but not at him. Biting her lip,
            again, shoulders raised and head sunken into them a little. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Um&hellip;&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps, more importantly, he notices, she&#39;s embarrassed. About what she&#39;s
            about to say.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s okay, Chisa,&quot; he says gently. &quot;Tell me. I want to know. No
            matter what it is.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s&hellip;stupid.&quot; She mutters. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;d
            like it anymore.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A lot of memories flash to mind and his heart skips a beat. There
            are&hellip;some&hellip;that he can see. But, he would try. He could work something out.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You won&#39;t know until you tell me.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She curls in more.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He smiles gently, a little proud of what he&#39;s about to say but he&#39;ll work
            with it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">&quot;You won&#39;t know until you </span><span class="c8">ask</span><span
            class="c0">, right?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She freezes and looks at him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c8">I won&#39;t get mad</span><span class="c10">, he wants to say. But he doesn&#39;t
            know if it might have the opposite effect of calming her down. </span><span class="c8">I love you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&hellip;&quot; she takes a deep breath. Then another.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He waits. Strangely calm.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She mutters, &quot;I want to braid your hair. Or something.
            Maybe&hellip;flowers.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.5v8ivjd8owy5"><span class="c5">A Specialty</span></h2>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He blinks. She wants to&hellip;braid his hair? </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Small hands.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Caught in his hair.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Smiling, laughing.</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">He smiles back.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Despite the sharp pain at the roots.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Gently, untangling her fingers.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">But also,</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Giving her looser stands not so close to his head.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s&hellip;that&#39;s what&hellip;?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Another time</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Preparing for a formal dinner.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Long strands of cloth.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Woven into his hair.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Chisa too excited to help.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">They end up askew, but -</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">He laughs, and tells her,</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">It makes it special.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">You can&#39;t plan these odd angles.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Chisa Special Arrangement</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I-I mean, I didn&#39;t mean. I, that&#39;s -&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">It was never flowers.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s embarrassed by his gut reaction and with him stumbling over his words. Chisa
            is frozen in place and it scares him more than anything.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Could he hold her and tell her it&#39;s fine?</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I just didn&#39;t expect. That.&quot; Part of him felt relieved it could be
            such a simple thing. But part of him hurt that it was something so..so minor.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">To him, it might have been. But to Chisa it wasn&#39;t. She had said it after
            all.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, those memories pressing against his mind. The idea of doing that was
            probably&hellip;important to him too.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He holds out an arm as an invitation for a hug. Something so natural that he used to
            do. He smiles. Tries to, he thinks, because she looks just as frozen as before. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He fights the growing disappointment from showing on his face with each
            second.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where did he go wrong? </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He lowers his arm slowly, open and away from his side so she could squirrel away if
            she changed her mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She let out a breath neither of them realized she was holding. She starts to blink
            rapidly as tears begin to form in her eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Chisa,&quot; he said softly. She blinked at him, registering her name.
            &quot;What flowers do you want to get?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;H-huh?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We could go now. Or later. We&#39;ve got time.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Y-you&#39;re not mad?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He shakes his head.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You sure?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He smirks and his eyes glint mischievously before he swiftly leans forward and scoop
            &nbsp;Chisa into his arms. She yelps and he tucks her head under his own and holds her securely.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He strokes her back. Slowly, gently. Tracing old patterns from a lifetime ago. She
            shivers once before slowly relaxing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have thought of flowers.&quot; He admits quietly. &quot;But you
            did love to play with my hair.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She makes a non-committal response.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it, Chisa?&rdquo; he asks softly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thought it might be too&hellip;girly&hellip;or something.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was partially true. There are lots of &#39;girly&#39; things he did, but flowers
            were not one of them. He wouldn&#39;t have put flowers in his hair or would have liked it someone else had.
            He could play it off as a joke.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">But for Chisa? He could do that. He would try.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c9" id="h.kkg1q8r78pfl"><span>(Maybe: </span><span class="c5">Why I guess I Dunno)</span></h2>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why did you pick a ring, anyways?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hums.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I know you said you weren&#39;t really thinking but&hellip;what made you pick
            it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well&hellip;&quot; Where to begin? &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you try jewelry,
            but the spinning I thought might help with your fidgeting. Not that it&#39;s a bad thing,&quot; he continues
            calmly, &quot;but I know it can help. Besides&hellip; maybe it would be the first ring you might have
            liked.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He chuckles lightly, not expecting anything from it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It was a toy shop, so it wasn&#39;t expensive,&quot; nor is money really an
            issue for Angels but she didn&#39;t need to worry about that, &quot;and there were plenty of options. Dolls
            and such, many that were like what you had before.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks back at her, and a bit beyond her at a memory rising up.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Your grandmother gave you one, if you can remember,&quot; his voice sounded
            farther away than where they were. &quot;She wasn&#39;t around long, and you were very young then. I had to
            keep patching that doll. It was&hellip;made with love, shall we say.&quot; He meant it warmly, truly.

    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chisa stares wide eyed at him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It shouldn&#39;t have been that difficult but I was&hellip;impatient. But, I
            did figure it out, to fiind a way to make it easy to remove the clothes and the hair, and fashion new
            clothes from the leftover textiles that didn&#39;t make it into our shop. The hair was done differently -
            sometimes cloth, sometimes yarn - all depending on what we had and what you wanted.&quot;</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He pulls gently and the edges of his coat. Lost in those days. Those much, much,
            simpler days. But also, in a life that he wasn&#39;t able to fully live in.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span>Pillowfort post: </span><span class="c18"><a class="c14"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/4886838&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1724229244118232&amp;usg=AOvVaw1pebUkraNIbSRd02-8I0k-">https://www.pillowfort.social/posts/4886838</a></span><span
            class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He adored the little grey cat he introduced his family to and so he figured it would
            make a good project to get back into doll making. Since Chisa disliked cats, which was very unfortunate, it
            meant he didn&#39;t have to worry about making the cat perfect. It made a wonderful starter project that he
            enjoyed before he delved into Chisa&#39;s actual present.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He tossed his tools into his sunny branded messenger bag lying on the bench next to
            him and he inspected the finished amigurumi. He was a little rusty from when he used to fiddle with dolls
            but he was satisfied with the result. Sure the ears weren&#39;t aligned but they were from his own handmade
            modifications from a simple pattern he found but it worked out. All in all, it resembled a gray cat, is
            cute, and, well, complete!</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">He also didn&#39;t </span><span class="c8">cheat</span><span class="c0">, which
            meant the finished doll actually turned out as a proper and complete doll.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He squished the head and body. It could use some more stuffing but it seemed decent
            enough. it could be a good stress kitty.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Father?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He whips his head up to see Chisa standing next to him and looking back him. He
            ignored the unsettling feeling that he never sensed her approach and fought the urge to hide the cat since
            it was very clearly in his hands. He lets himself relax, aligning himself vibes of the peaceful, sunny
            afternoon in the park.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, he offered making her a doll in the first place, so why hide his practice
            project? Perhaps they could both figure out more about what kind of doll she wants.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello Chisa,&quot; he greets warmly. &quot;Didn&#39;t expect to see you down
            here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello...&quot; her voice already trailing off as her eyes land on the cotton
            kitty in his hands. Her brown eyes widened briefly before narrowing slightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">&quot;It&#39;s a test doll,&quot; he explains before her thoughts jump to who knows
            what conclusions. &quot;Wanted to make something </span><span class="c8">I </span><span class="c0">would be
            at least interested in before starting yours. Something quick, nothing fancy.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You made this?&quot; She blinks a few times. &quot;...By hand?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yep. Test it out.&quot; She takes the doll from his outstretched hands and then
            he pulls up his bag and reaches inside.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She turns it over, fingers running along the stitches. &quot;No
            cheating?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Nooope!&quot; He pulls out the crochet hook and some of the yarn he used. Her
            eyes flicker to the yarn and hook briefly before returning back to her doll inspection. He won&#39;t go into
            the details of how he obtained the items, but the construction of the amigurumi itself was made without any
            special powers. Therefore, &#39;not cheating&#39;. He puts the yarn and hook back into his bag.
            &quot;Definitely places to improve and could use some more stuffing. But, all-in-all, it&#39;s a complete
            kitty doll.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m surprised.&quot; She says quietly. She gives the head a little squish
            and a small smile tugs on her mouth as the kitty&#39;s facial features squish with it. She sits down beside
            him, gently poking and squishing the body. She doesn&#39;t vocalize the rest of her thought, but given the
            special powers they have, and for how long he&#39;s had his and used it for simple things, she must have
            thought he wouldn&#39;t have resisted in some fashion.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her hands run around the triangular ears and then she gives the head a stronger
            squish with the palm of her hand. It&#39;s absent minded, with no intention to see the tension of the
            stitches, to seek any sign of stuffing peaking through. Maybe he could make her something small to squish as
            well. Something better to fidget with instead of her hands or a poorly thought out gift. Then she could test
            out materials, sizes, the amount of stuffing her doll should have and the like.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, that could work.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Anyways,&quot; he reaches a hand out to take the cat doll from her,
            &quot;I&#39;ll make a few sample head shapes with some other types of yarn I picked up so you can see what
            you&#39;d like. Put different amounts of stuffing in them too so you test for desired
            squishiness.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">His hand remains empty as she continues to hold the cat doll very carefully in her
            hands. It&#39;s almost as if she&#39;s afraid she might break it. He made the doll well. She&#39;s not a
            young child so he knows she won&#39;t wear it down that quickly, but he did make sure it would hold together
            for a long, long time at the very least. That should have been obvious from the squishing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Chisa?&quot; He prods lightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looks at him finally and then to his open hand. She blinks a few times before she
            gasps. &quot;Oh! Do you need this back?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">Well, he doesn&#39;t </span><span class="c8">need</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the
            cat back but...</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It was a test,&quot; he says carefully, &quot;I didn&#39;t intend to... give it
            to anyone, really.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;...Right.&quot; She says quietly and he catches a hint of sadness in it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He takes, not really a risk per say, but, the worst result is he would confirm
            he&#39;s right.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is there anything wrong with it?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No...&quot; she answers slowly, her eyes returning to the cat. She squishes the
            tail. &quot;It&#39;s...cute.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;For a cat?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Um... yeah.&quot; She agrees, but then she adds, &quot;It&#39;s...really cute.
            And...warm.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Warm?&quot; He voices his confusion.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She hums. &quot;It&#39;s like... I can feel like your love of cats put into it. And I
            can&#39;t wait to... to see what my doll will be like.&quot; She nervously smiles. &quot;It feels
            nice.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course. He slowly lowers his outstretched hand. Given their heightened senses, she
            would pick up on the emotions put into the doll. However, it wasn&#39;t just his affection towards cats that
            was poured into that doll. It was for Chisa too. Even though it wasn&#39;t for her, what he practiced then
            would be for her, so that&#39;s more of what she&#39;s picking up from it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knows what that feels like. He remembers when Joshua custom ordered a handmade Mr.
            Mew cushion. While he didn&#39;t make the item itself, the care from the crafter and Joshua&#39;s intent was
            felt in the cushion itself. A warmth that stays and is something you don&#39;t want to give up.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He swallows as not only does he understand why she doesn&#39;t want to give it up,
            but also that today is Father&#39;s Day. The same day he recieved that cushion from Joshua. He doesn&#39;t
            expect Chisa to keep track of holidays, he doesn&#39;t really either, but it still hits him hard in the
            heart.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well,&quot; he says the best he can past the sudden lump in his throat.
            &quot;The kitty is yours.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Really?!&quot; She stares at him in shock. &quot;But - I thought - Are you -
            ?&quot; She stumbles over each thought she tries to voice all at once.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah,&quot; he smiles strongly and says with more confidence at how well
            received the idea is. &quot;You like it. And I&#39;m...happy to see that.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wishes he could have ended that better but her smile and teary eyes tells him
            it&#39;s enough. It&#39;s a gift on its own.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">&quot;Thank you!&quot; She leans over and hugs him and he wraps his arms around her
            in return. Her joy radiates through to him. &quot;I&#39;ll treasure this kitty! And </span><span
            class="c8">only</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;this kitty.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He chuckles, running a hand up and down her back. &quot;At least there&#39;s one kind
            of cat that you can tolerate.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She giggles. &quot;Well, it&#39;s squishy.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fair enough, he supposes. Fair enough. He&#39;ll take it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
