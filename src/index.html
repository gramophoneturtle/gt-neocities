<p>Heyo and welcome, to a sneak peak of my website!</p>

<p>This will be my art and maybe one day fandom page! Meaning, not only will there be ART on here, but also...some of the TWEWY language comparison stuff? Heck yeah, yeah?
    Feel free to check stuff out, but it will probably change a lot until it's ready to launch!</p>

<p>{% include 'partials/rss-feed-links.njk' %}</p>

<p>Enjoy your stay!</p>

<p class="notice"><b>WARNING!</b> 
    The URLs of art pages is a WIP. These main pages should be safe to bookmark, but not the fandom lists or individual art pages.
