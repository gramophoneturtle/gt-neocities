<p>Heyo and welcome, to a sneak peak of my website!</p>
<p>This will be my art and maybe one day fandom page!</p>
<p>Meaning, not only will there be ART on here, but also...some of the TWEWY language comparison stuff? Heck yeah, yeah?</p>

<p>Feel free to check stuff out, but it will probably change a lot until it's ready to launch!</p>
<p>Enjoy your stay.</p>

<p class="notice"><b>WARNING!</b> 
    The URLs of art pages is a WIP. These main pages should be safe to bookmark, but not the fandom lists or individual art pages.
</p>
